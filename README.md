It is Car price prediction by using machine learning 

# Required Libraries
Numpy,pandas,Matplotlib,seaborn and sklearn

# data Collection
Collected dataset from kaggle 

# Finding Missing Values
In this Dataset there is no null values
If there is null values then we check with null value features with output feature is there relation
If there is no relation then we can delete 

# Fearture Engineering
Convert categorical features to numeric features to understand model better

# Model
In this im used random forest regressor it gives accuracy around 95
